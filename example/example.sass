  INFO: This is example is based on a starfield which I generated by using the Stargazer Library.
  So the Stars will Shine up, wehen theire classname will be extended by the setMorphClass,
  which is blink in this case. A Starfield simply styled by CSS.

#container 
  margin: 0
  height: 98.25vh
  background-color: #202
  background: linear-gradient( -90deg, #202 40%, #101 100% )
  overflow: hidden

.star 
    position: absolute
    top: 50%
    left: 50%
    width: 1px
    height: 1px
    background-color: #eaeaea
    transition: 1s ease
    will-change: transform
    &.blink
        transform: translate( -50%, -50% ) scale(2)
        filter: drop-shadow( 0 0 3px rgba(255,255,255,1) )
